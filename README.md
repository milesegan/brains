# brains
## about
This is the home of my ongoing experiments in machine learning in
python. It includes implementations of various classification,
clustering, and regression methods.

### clustering methods
* kmeans
* single-link
* spanning tree

### classification methods
* naive bayes
* decision tree

### regression methods
* neural net

## testing
To run the tests, install nose and execute this command in
the root of the brains distribution:
    
    nosetests -v
